Released in 2005 the functionality it offered was convenient. I have tried multiple times applications to replace this, but none offered the same level of simplicity. I love RSS as a concept because it empowers open decentralised distribution. The consumer gets to control the feeds they consume. You choose your feeds. As long as you&amp;rsquo;re just sorting by date there is no ‘algorithm&amp;rsquo; nudging you in one direction or another.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A year of the Linux desktop</title><link>https://trootski.github.io/post/2024/11/longest-linux-run-yet/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trootski.github.io/post/2024/11/longest-linux-run-yet/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have previously had multiple forays into Linux as my main desktop. This has generally ended with a return to macOS at some point for one reason or another. This pattern has recently repeated itself. However, I think it’s worth recording that this time the switch back was not due to any irreconcilable issue.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What I wished I'd known before working with Apache Camel</title><link>https://trootski.github.io/post/2021/12/what-i-wished-id-known-before-working-with-apache-camel/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trootski.github.io/post/2021/12/what-i-wished-id-known-before-working-with-apache-camel/</guid><description>I recently started working on an Apache Camel project at work. The application in question would, I imagine, have been an atypical use case for Apache Camel. It was used primarily for the DSL definition of a series of RESTful calls to dependent services. These routes were leveraged by the application’s controller layer.
My approach at the beginning and my approach by the end were pretty different.
Unless stated the below are examples are taken from the Apache Camel Wish I&amp;rsquo;d Known sample code on GitHub.</description></item><item><title>Bond Project</title><link>https://trootski.github.io/post/2021/01/bond-project/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trootski.github.io/post/2021/01/bond-project/</guid><description>While looking at various microservice patterns I found I wanted a playground for playing with components of a microservice based system in isolation.
Coincidentally, in the halcyon days of winter 2019 I got an idea to binge all the James Bond films. Over the years I had seen them all. I generally watched them on television but never in any order and usually having missed the start. After having re-watched one of the movies I wrote down a very short hot take on each film.</description></item><item><title>Spring Handle Constraint Violation</title><link>https://trootski.github.io/post/2020/12/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trootski.github.io/post/2020/12/</guid><description>My team recently had a requirement to build a persistence mechanism that had a unique constraint on a combination of columns. It needed to behave in an idempotent manner. If the same request was received to created an entity multiple times it would simply respond that the items existed. I spent a considerable amount of effort researching a solution and wound up with something immeasurably simpler than some of my early stabs at it.</description></item><item><title>Story Templates</title><link>https://trootski.github.io/post/2019/04/story-templates/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trootski.github.io/post/2019/04/story-templates/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have been looking after some JIRA boards recently.

I think the crux of the issue is a difference between the latest driver available and the best driver for a machine.
The details are that the laptop is an Acer Aspire V5-122P. It is a cheap and cheerful laptop that I purchased for the following reasons:
Backup machine in case my daily driver broke down, Low powered machine to test performance of websites, Laptop I could take travelling without undue stress as to it&amp;rsquo;s wellbeing.</description></item><item><title>My favourite bash shortcuts</title><link>https://trootski.github.io/post/2018/10/my-favourite-bash-shortcuts/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trootski.github.io/post/2018/10/my-favourite-bash-shortcuts/</guid><description>I recently transitioned from using vi mode in bash to the default command line shortcuts. I had ignored them for a long time but after a brief period sitting and learning a few I no longer missed vi mode. Some of the key reasons that prompted me to change are:
vi mode does not have a visual prompt, leading to unecassary escape smashing I only used the most basic motion command, eschewing a lot of the power of the vi commands When ssh&amp;rsquo;ing into other boxes the switch in interface is jarring.</description></item><item><title>What I’ve learned about cucumber js</title><link>https://trootski.github.io/post/2018/03/what-ive-learned-about-cucumber-js/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trootski.github.io/post/2018/03/what-ive-learned-about-cucumber-js/</guid><description>CucumberJS is a NodeJS implementation of a test runner which is powered by the Gherkin syntax. It&amp;rsquo;s integration with our team workflow has been a boon to clarity of purpose for stories in firstly SCRUM and now KANBAN. Here I will share some of things we&amp;rsquo;re doing and the benefits we reap.
When writing a story the team gathers around a screen and we work on a shared text. Straight away this increases collaboration and removes a lot of later disagreements around &amp;lsquo;I thought we said we would do X after Y&amp;rsquo;.</description></item><item><title>Delete last word</title><link>https://trootski.github.io/post/2018/02/delete-last-word/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trootski.github.io/post/2018/02/delete-last-word/</guid><description>Coming from vim I´m used to a wide variety of keystrokes to manipulate text. The other day at work though my mind was blown when a colleague hit alt + backspace to delete the previous word in macOS. This was particularly useful because in Terminal I am used to pressing ctrl+w. This will delete the previous word as well, but it terminal it does not respect delimeters such as ´_/´_ or ´_-´_.</description></item><item><title>Back to Windows</title><link>https://trootski.github.io/post/2016/02/back-to-windows/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trootski.github.io/post/2016/02/back-to-windows/</guid><description>I recently put Windows 10 onto my little Acer. It was a practical decision. I enjoyed Ubuntu but had a real problem with the impact on battery performance. After 40 to 50 minutes the battery would generally be depleted.
So, I downloaded a Windows 8 ISO from Microsoft and began the installation. It took a loooooong time (it&amp;rsquo;s not a very performant laptop). Eventually I got Windows 8 installed, upgraded to Windows 10, sorted out activation issue with Acer and Microsoft.</description></item><item><title>Outlook Kung-Fu</title><link>https://trootski.github.io/post/2015/11/outlook-kung-fu/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Nov 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trootski.github.io/post/2015/11/outlook-kung-fu/</guid><description>While in the process of doing some HTML emails recently I had some issues with Outlook.

I should note here that we use shared hosting extensively. Ideally the preferred solution would be to use a true migration tool. This is not always possible with shared hosting.
To use the tool the following commands would be issued:

Once I have my slices defined and selected a folder Photoshop will save all my images in the folder I specified. However it will also create an images folder and place the images this folder. This means I that after saving the files they must be moved out of this folder.</description></item><item><title>ssh as part of my workflow</title><link>https://trootski.github.io/post/2014/12/ssh-as-part-of-my-workflow/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trootski.github.io/post/2014/12/ssh-as-part-of-my-workflow/</guid><description>Have you ever been in the situation where the discovery of a technology or technique has rendered previous workflow comically inept and wasteful. One such example would be the discovery of the &amp;ldquo;edit multiple frames&amp;rdquo; button in Adobe Flash Professional. I had spent so much time moving from frame to frame to edit a tween. Then to discover that I could choose the entire animation as one and edit. Joy and sorrow in the one same wave of realisation.</description></item><item><title>Early PC top 5</title><link>https://trootski.github.io/post/2014/12/early-pc-top-5/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trootski.github.io/post/2014/12/early-pc-top-5/</guid><description>While doing my recent top 5 Amiga games, I got to thinking about the early PC games that I also enjoyed. I got into PC gaming in the late 90s and early noughties. Please note, these are merely the games that I particularly enjoyed:
X-Wing: Alliance Included in this is the entire X-Wing series, but I started with Alliance. Needs a joystick, but the inclusion of the requirement to manage your ship&amp;rsquo;s energy (lasers/shields/engines) adds another dimension.</description></item><item><title>Amiga Top Five</title><link>https://trootski.github.io/post/2014/11/amiga-top-five/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trootski.github.io/post/2014/11/amiga-top-five/</guid><description>I was thinking recently about the amount of time I spent playing games when I was younger. I don&amp;rsquo;t have as much appetite any longer for playing games. The only game I play now is Team Fortress 2, and even that very irregularly. The only game that would probably take me back into the market is Half Life 3&amp;hellip;
So, to archive my gaming childhood, I decided to put together the accompanying list.</description></item><item><title>Vagrant and Puppet setup</title><link>https://trootski.github.io/post/2014/10/vagrant-and-puppet-setup/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trootski.github.io/post/2014/10/vagrant-and-puppet-setup/</guid><description>This summer during my holidays in Romania I looked into Vagrant. I had some time during the due to the heat, undertaking my own siesta without the sleep.
My path to to Vagrant was slightly oblique, as I had been looking to test out Puppet. I had been using VirtualBox virtual machines as an integral part of my development and testing process for some time. The promise of making this an automated and scripted process for my development environment appealed to me.</description></item><item><title>New Rig</title><link>https://trootski.github.io/post/2014/01/new-rig/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trootski.github.io/post/2014/01/new-rig/</guid><description>As a sort of follow up to the article here I decided to continue to attempt to scratch my Linux itch.
Reasoning that maybe virtual machines aren&amp;rsquo;t a fair reflection of a system&amp;rsquo;s capabilities I went and bought a little netbook. I went for a little Acer Aspire in the January sales. This is a relatively cheap model, but it was the Christmas break so I had a little bit of time to kill.</description></item><item><title>Grunt setup</title><link>https://trootski.github.io/post/2013/11/grunt-setup/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trootski.github.io/post/2013/11/grunt-setup/</guid><description>This article might be helpful to anybody who satisfies the following criteria:
Wants to run Grunt On a Mac Running Linux through VirtualBox Using a shared folder for the directory you want to install packages If this describes your situation, you probably have run into errors installing the local version of Grunt through npm
The reason for these errors might be that your Shared Folder doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually support symlinks.

One point that constantly caused me issues was how to setup users.
The basic setup I wanted was for an FTP user to be able to login, upload some files and the web server to serve them. When I was first looking at this I was thinking in terms of real users. This issue with this was that the real user would have real file permissions.</description></item><item><title>i3 wm</title><link>https://trootski.github.io/post/2013/10/i3-wm/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trootski.github.io/post/2013/10/i3-wm/</guid><description>Had a nice play recently with the i3 wm for Linux.
It&amp;rsquo;s a really nice paradigm for working with when programming. It uses the same style of keyboard navigation as vim for moving around your windows.
The windows key can be bound as your modifier key and then used to navigate to a particular workspace (e.g. Windows + 2 to go to the browser workspace). Particular applications can be configured to open only on certain workspaces.</description></item><item><title>SSD upgrade MacBook Pro</title><link>https://trootski.github.io/post/2013/09/ssd-upgrade-macbook-pro/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trootski.github.io/post/2013/09/ssd-upgrade-macbook-pro/</guid><description>Tutorials I recently updated my hard drive on my MacBook Pro to an SSD drive.

Thus was born a website that used an iphone, a handy iPhone app called SendLocation, a little lamp coding, google maps api and some html/css/javascript to update Ronans location throughout the trip.</description></item><item><title>Baby steps with Python</title><link>https://trootski.github.io/post/2011/06/baby-steps-with-python/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trootski.github.io/post/2011/06/baby-steps-with-python/</guid><description>Started out playing around with Python as a scripting tool. Have to say, it really is a neat mix of the kinda power and libraries I&amp;rsquo;m used to with Perl and the flexibility of a pure scripting language.
Just for a giggle, I decided to re-write my C# backup script to backup some of my mac folders. Most of the language I&amp;rsquo;m still getting my head around. 4 times out of ten, each line gets a semi-colon.</description></item><item><title>Got a new bike</title><link>https://trootski.github.io/post/2011/05/got-a-new-bike/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 May 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trootski.github.io/post/2011/05/got-a-new-bike/</guid><description>Picked up a 07 Honda Hornet 600F a week ago.

The lads have integrated their system with a C# port of the lucene search engine library. From what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen so far, this gives developers really powerful search and sorting options. A summary of some these options can be found here http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_1_0/queryparsersyntax.html.
