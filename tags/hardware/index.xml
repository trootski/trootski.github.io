I think the crux of the issue is a difference between the latest driver available and the best driver for a machine.
The details are that the laptop is an Acer Aspire V5-122P. It is a cheap and cheerful laptop that I purchased for the following reasons:
Backup machine in case my daily driver broke down, Low powered machine to test performance of websites, Laptop I could take travelling without undue stress as to it&amp;rsquo;s wellbeing.</description></item><item><title>New Rig</title><link>https://trootski.github.io/post/2014/01/new-rig/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trootski.github.io/post/2014/01/new-rig/</guid><description>As a sort of follow up to the article here I decided to continue to attempt to scratch my Linux itch.
Reasoning that maybe virtual machines aren&amp;rsquo;t a fair reflection of a system&amp;rsquo;s capabilities I went and bought a little netbook. I went for a little Acer Aspire in the January sales. This is a relatively cheap model, but it was the Christmas break so I had a little bit of time to kill.</description></item><item><title>SSD upgrade MacBook Pro</title><link>https://trootski.github.io/post/2013/09/ssd-upgrade-macbook-pro/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trootski.github.io/post/2013/09/ssd-upgrade-macbook-pro/</guid><description>Tutorials I recently updated my hard drive on my MacBook Pro to an SSD drive. I used the following tutorials to do the upgrade, which was pretty stratightforward:
The second video is particularly interesting. You can purchase a cradle for another hard drive. This can be used either for you existing hard drive, or a second identical SSD that you can then put in RAID configuration.

Two little things to come out of it though:
Taking hard drives out of mac books is actually relatively painless. It merely involves 3 screws, a likkle screwdriver and an L-plate behind the battery. A little external hard drive case (nicely provided by Darran) can save a lot of bother. Simply remove the hard drive, insert it into the case, plug into another computer and with any luck your hard drive is up and running</description></item><item><title>Oh me of little faith</title><link>https://trootski.github.io/post/2007/12/oh-me-of-little-faith/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Dec 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trootski.github.io/post/2007/12/oh-me-of-little-faith/</guid><description>Not two days after I posted with my Apple MacBook problem the good people at apple have released a fix, Huzzah</description></item><item><title>MacBook Pro Leopard upgrade problem</title><link>https://trootski.github.io/post/2007/12/macbook-pro-leopard-upgrade-problem/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Dec 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trootski.github.io/post/2007/12/macbook-pro-leopard-upgrade-problem/</guid><description>Nice one, upgraded to Mac OS X Leopard recently. All very snazzy and apple like, icons flying from this angle, little transitions everywhere. Recently though, when I go to type I get a big fat nothing on the screen.

Got onto the oh so nice people at Dell, excellent customer service. Drive had more errors than a dyslexic at a spelling bee. Managed to get it booted up again though and got some stuff off it. Then Dell sent out a replacement drive, nice.
Learned a valuable lesson. The two most important locations to back up if you use Thunderbird and Firefox:</description></item></channel></rss>
