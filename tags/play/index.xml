I got into PC gaming in the late 90s and early noughties. Please note, these are merely the games that I particularly enjoyed:
X-Wing: Alliance Included in this is the entire X-Wing series, but I started with Alliance. Needs a joystick, but the inclusion of the requirement to manage your ship&amp;rsquo;s energy (lasers/shields/engines) adds another dimension.</description></item><item><title>Amiga Top Five</title><link>https://trootski.github.io/post/2014/11/amiga-top-five/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trootski.github.io/post/2014/11/amiga-top-five/</guid><description>I was thinking recently about the amount of time I spent playing games when I was younger. I don&amp;rsquo;t have as much appetite any longer for playing games. The only game I play now is Team Fortress 2, and even that very irregularly. The only game that would probably take me back into the market is Half Life 3&amp;hellip;
So, to archive my gaming childhood, I decided to put together the accompanying list.</description></item><item><title>Lists of lists</title><link>https://trootski.github.io/post/2009/10/lists-of-lists/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Oct 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://trootski.github.io/post/2009/10/lists-of-lists/</guid><description>In the past few months I&amp;rsquo;ve run into quite a few &amp;rsquo;list&amp;rsquo; site.
