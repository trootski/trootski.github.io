It needed to behave in an idempotent manner. If the same request was received to created an entity multiple times it would simply respond that the items existed. I spent a considerable amount of effort researching a solution and wound up with something immeasurably simpler than some of my early stabs at it.</description></item><item><title>Outlook Kung-Fu</title><link>http://localhost:1313/post/2015/11/outlook-kung-fu/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Nov 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/post/2015/11/outlook-kung-fu/</guid><description>While in the process of doing some HTML emails recently I had some issues with Outlook.
Stinky, sneaky Outlook. I learned a few little techniques though that are worth sharing.
Only show this on Outlook First and foremost, only show the content between the conditionals on Outlook.

I should note here that we use shared hosting extensively. Ideally the preferred solution would be to use a true migration tool. This is not always possible with shared hosting.
To use the tool the following commands would be issued:
migrate_wordpress.sh dev production This command would pull the latest version of the wordpress database from the production server.</description></item><item><title>Google Reader Replacement (follow up)</title><link>http://localhost:1313/post/2013/09/google-reader-replacement-follow-up/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/post/2013/09/google-reader-replacement-follow-up/</guid><description>I spent a bit of time today customising my RSSOwl setup to make it more to my liking. I now have it looking like this:
That&amp;rsquo;s one long reader with all my feeds. Here&amp;rsquo;s how I did it.
Select View -&amp;gt; Layout -&amp;gt; Newspaper Deselect View -&amp;gt; Toolbars -&amp;gt; Feed Toolbar Deselect View -&amp;gt; Status Right Click Main Toolbar and select Customise Toolbar Delete everything except New, Update All, Mark Read, Mark All Read, Search (or whatever is your preference) Right Click Main Toolbar and select Lock Toolbar Click Search, do a search for all titles not containing something impossible (eg asjdlfjkasdfkdaj) Save search (I called mine &amp;ldquo;All News&amp;rdquo;) Select the newly created &amp;ldquo;All News&amp;rdquo; category from your feeds (More details on this here: http://tutorial.</description></item><item><title>Axure - Wireframing Application</title><link>http://localhost:1313/post/2013/05/axure-wireframing-application/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/post/2013/05/axure-wireframing-application/</guid><description>I recently started using Axure as my primary wireframing application. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried a couple of other solutions in the past, such as balsamiq and Adobe Illustrator.
There&amp;rsquo;s a good article here which discusses some of the other alternatives: http://www.creativebloq.com/wireframes/top-wireframing-tools-11121302
My own criteria for selection were:
No web apps While I love cloud based solutions for some stuff, for my core apps I loathe anything that requires connectivity to use. If I have my laptop, I should be able to do my work, regardless of whether I have access to the internet.</description></item><item><title>Google Reader Replacement</title><link>http://localhost:1313/post/2013/04/google-reader-replacement/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/post/2013/04/google-reader-replacement/</guid><description>Google Reader is going the way of the dodo. I am/was an active Reader user. Mostly from the browser while I had some spare minutes I would dip and read some of the latest news.
The news hast left me somewhat wary of online alternatives. There have been quite a few mentioned:

I&amp;rsquo;m amazed at how good it is. Ok, I can still type on a keyboard faster, but still it&amp;rsquo;s a marked improvement from other keyboards out there.
I have felt lately that whomever can find a way to make text input on a tablet/smartphone would go a long way to bridging the gap between the traditional PC and current hand held devices.</description></item><item><title>Facebook apps ahoy</title><link>http://localhost:1313/post/2011/12/facebook-apps-ahoy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/post/2011/12/facebook-apps-ahoy/</guid><description>We recently finished up on a couple of facebook apps at Brando. The first, an app for Lifestyle Sports, gave me a chance to look further into the Wowza server and live streaming. The cam seems to be broadcasting though and I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a few things about setup for this. I&amp;rsquo;m quite happy with the results.
The first was for BUPI. It allowed the user to upload an image of their child, and then put them in a Christmas card.</description></item><item><title>Strobe Media Player</title><link>http://localhost:1313/post/2011/10/strobe-media-player/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Oct 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/post/2011/10/strobe-media-player/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve done a lot of flash video players over the years. Too many.
Some had custom interfaces, some used the default flash video component. Others were completely custom, managing the stream events and displaying the video in the vanilla video component. Then Dave came to me with the OSMF Strobe Media Playback component.
We had tried the JW Player a couple of times before, but found the per domain price a little excessive outside of large clients.</description></item><item><title>Wordpress wp_nav_menu output class when menu item has children</title><link>http://localhost:1313/post/2011/09/wordpress-wp_nav_menu-output-class-when-menu-item-has-children/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Sep 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/post/2011/09/wordpress-wp_nav_menu-output-class-when-menu-item-has-children/</guid><description>I recently wanted to insert a class for the case where a menu item has children in Wordpress. There doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear to be any option to do this in wp_nav_menu function, so I started doing some research.
I found out from this article how to add a &amp;lsquo;last-menu-item&amp;rsquo; css class.
This doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite work for what I wanted though, because the returned data object from Wordpress doesn&amp;rsquo;t tell you if the current node has children.</description></item><item><title>Tour De Picnic</title><link>http://localhost:1313/post/2011/09/tour-de-picnic/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Sep 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/post/2011/09/tour-de-picnic/</guid><description>Ronan Murphy, Dave Clarke, David Byrne and I recently put a site live for Tour De Picnic. This is a charity cycle to the Electric Picnic festival in Stradbally in aid of Temple Street Hospital. Ronan was doing the cycle and we decided it would be nice to track him on his journey.
Thus was born a website that used an iphone, a handy iPhone app called SendLocation, a little lamp coding, google maps api and some html/css/javascript to update Ronans location throughout the trip.</description></item><item><title>Baby steps with Python</title><link>http://localhost:1313/post/2011/06/baby-steps-with-python/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/post/2011/06/baby-steps-with-python/</guid><description>Started out playing around with Python as a scripting tool. Have to say, it really is a neat mix of the kinda power and libraries I&amp;rsquo;m used to with Perl and the flexibility of a pure scripting language.
Just for a giggle, I decided to re-write my C# backup script to backup some of my mac folders. Most of the language I&amp;rsquo;m still getting my head around. 4 times out of ten, each line gets a semi-colon.</description></item><item><title>Be The Difference gets a Cannes Lion and a One Show merit</title><link>http://localhost:1313/post/2010/07/be-the-difference-gets-a-cannes-lion-and-a-one-show-merit-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jul 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/post/2010/07/be-the-difference-gets-a-cannes-lion-and-a-one-show-merit-2/</guid><description>Be The Difference 2010 has picked up a one show merit and a cannes lion.

We&amp;rsquo;re using the Kentico CMS, and came across the following while building some search based functionality: http://www.kentico.com/Docs/DevGuide/smart_search_overview.htm
The lads have integrated their system with a C# port of the lucene search engine library. From what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen so far, this gives developers really powerful search and sorting options. A summary of some these options can be found here http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_1_0/queryparsersyntax.html.
Like I say, I&amp;rsquo;ve only started on this, and will update this post when the project is finished.</description></item><item><title>Sweet sweet bronze</title><link>http://localhost:1313/post/2010/04/sweet-sweet-bronze/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Apr 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/post/2010/04/sweet-sweet-bronze/</guid><description>An MSN takeover Brando did for O2 last year picked up a bronze at the ICAD awards last week.

I&amp;rsquo;ve been hearing about it and scuttling around it for a while now. I&amp;rsquo;ll preface this by saying that I&amp;rsquo;ve only been using this for a short while, so I may just not have found some stuff out. So far I&amp;rsquo;m digging it. The concept is very simple, sms for web. That&amp;rsquo;s it.
